# Module 9 - Lab 7 - Exercise 1 - Create Public Folders

Holly Dickson wants to continue with her examination of messaging in Microsoft 365, and more specifically, with the use of public folders. In this lab, you will log into the Exchange admin center for Exchange Online and create a public folder mailbox and a public folder in Microsoft 365. 

## Task 1 - Create a Public Folder Mailbox

In this task, you will create a public folder mailbox as part of Holly’s Microsoft 365 pilot project. Every public folder must be contained in a public folder mailbox; therefore, you must create the public folder mailbox first before you can create a public folder.

1. You should still be logged into LON-CL1 from the prior lab; if necessary, log in as the **Administrator** with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.

2. In the Internet Explorer browser, the Office 365 home page, the Microsoft 365 admin center, and the Exchange admin center tabs should still be open. If so, select the **Exchange admin center** tab.  
‎  
‎However, if you closed your browser after the prior lab, then open Internet Explorer, navigate to **https://portal.office.com/**, sign in using the **Tenant Email** and **Password** provided by your lab hosting provider, open the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, and then navigate to the **Exchange admin center**. 

3. In the **Exchange admin center**, on the left-hand navigation pane, select **public folders**.

4. At the top of the **public folders** page, select the **public folder mailboxes** tab.

5. On the **public folder mailboxes** tab, select the **plus (+) sign** icon on the menu bar to add a new public folder mailbox. 

6. In the **new public folder mailbox** window enter **Test PF mailbox1** in the **Name** field, select **Save**, and then select **OK** once the information is successfully saved. 

7. This will return you to the **public folder mailboxes** list, which should now display **Test PF mailbox1**.

8. Leave all browser tabs open and proceed to the next task, where you will add a public folder. Once you have added the public folder, you will then assign it to this **Test PF mailbox1**.


## Task 2 - Create a Public Folder

Now that you have created a public folder mailbox, you can create a public folder.

1. You should still be in LON-CL1 and you should be in the **Exchange admin center** tab in your browser. 

2. In the **Exchange admin center**, you should still be in the **public folders** page, and you should be in the **public folder mailboxes** tab after having completed the prior task. Since you now want to create a public folder, select the **public folder** tab at the top of the page. 

3. In the **public folders** tab, select the **plus (+) sign** icon to add a new public folder. 

4. In the **new public folder** window, enter **Test PF1** in the **Name** field, select **Save,** and then select **OK** once the information is successfully saved.

5. This will return you to the **public folder** list, which should now display **Test PF1**.

6. Leave all browser tabs open and proceed to the next task, where you will enable mail settings for this **Test PF1** public folder.
